Dear Ms. Buonaccorso,

Within a couple of years Isar Aerospace has made a name for itself in the industry.
I believe all the the signs point that the company is in the right place and time to have a disruptive impact.
With the record breaking investment round of 2020 Isar Aerospace is undergoing a transition from a start-up with 20 employees to a large player in the industry. I can only imagine the mixture of excitement and pressure of being in this spotlight.

Isar Aerospace has set a grand mission for itself with the design of Spectrum. Every part of Spectrum is unique: the structural design, the propulsion system, the launchpad and the required infrastructure, to name a few. Taking the road less travelled requires not only the technical skills to find the solutions, but the ability to ask the right questions. At the same time, it is important to promptly deliver the prototyping and testing results to retain the attention of the investors and potential clients. To find working solutions to such novel approach it takes a team where every member has a set of multidisciplinary skills.

Throughout my career I felt best suited for new problem solving. My superiors often noted the same. When given a completely new challenge from a new field I may become engrossed in it. For example, at my current job I have faced many chemical processes that were completely new to me, such as hydrogenation reactors. After learning about these processes and analysing the system I highlighted the flaws in the design that would cost delays and losses during commissioning. Within 2-3 weeks I earned the reputation of a team expert in hydrogenation reactors. Stories similar to this are not unusual in my work. Now I feel ready to make a leap out of the Oil and Gas industry to match my strengths and interests.

For a successfull first launch and the further optimization to get to reliable and safe serial launches it may involve the following:

- Establish cost effective fuel specifications for optimal rocket engine performance.
- Concept, design and commission the propellant storage, transfer and filling facilities starting from the supplier to the launchpad.
- Work with the engineering contractors, i.e. prepare technical documentation and specifications, as well as validate the compatibility of the systems.
- Conduct safety review of the systems and the individual nodes.
- Model, simulate, prototype and test the individual parts of the system.

Working in chemical processing of hydrocarbons, I routinely performed these activities. It excites me to apply my skills and familiar methods in a new setting.

I am looking forward to discussing the position and my qualifications with you in more detail soon.

Sincerely,

Darkhan Sarsenov

P.S. I would love to learn more about Spectrum and Isar Aerospace or be a part of a crowdsourcing effort if needed and just provide any little help I can.
